PS5 listed on Amazon for an outrageous price – but it's clearly just a placeholder - ['Samuel Roberts']
A placeholder PS5 price was briefly listed on Amazon UK as £599.99 (around $765), and one person was reportedly able to buy the console before the item was removed.
Hot UK Deals screengrabbed a dummy ASIN page for the PS5, which listed the price in question, while a user called ashmac managed to pre-order the console before the listing vanished.
At £599.99, it would theoretically be the most expensive PlayStation console in UK history, beating the PS3 by £175.
Other PS5 dummy listings are making the roundsAccording to a tweet by the Wario64 games news account, various dummy listings have been unearthed for PS5 games, too.

Resident Evil 3 was a spinoff until Capcom changed its mind at the last minute - ['Alex Aniel', 'Dec']
Resident Evil CODE: Veronica was not “Resident Evil 3” in name, but Capcom’s intention was for it to be a proper continuation of the storyline of Resident Evil 2.
This third PlayStation Resident Evil game was given the title “Resident Evil 1.9.”One-point-nine“Resident Evil 1.9” would prove to be a very different project than both Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2.
Although there was only one scenario in “Resident Evil 1.9,” it would have more variation within that scenario than Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2 had in each of their scenarios.
After Aoyama’s project became Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Kamiya’s title was subsequently renamed to “Resident Evil 4” (Resident Evil CODE: Veronica was unaffected by this change).
While it seemed possible that Project Resistance could potentially occupy some of Capcom’s attention following the release of the Resident Evil 2 remake, the company decided to bundle the spinoff, now renamed Resident Evil Resistance, together with Resident Evil 3 to form a comprehensive single and multiplayer offering.

The history of PlayStation was almost very different - ['Blake Hester', 'Dec']
Share All sharing options for: The history of PlayStation was almost very differentThis week marked the 25th anniversary of Sony’s original PlayStation, a bet that went on to be an undeniable success for the company, with the PlayStation family of consoles having sold more than 430 million units since then.
